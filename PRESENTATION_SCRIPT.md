## [0:35-1:15] Directory Pages Overview
"Each directory page teaches visitors about a specific aspect of the house.

**Rumah Ibu** - The Main House. This page explains that it's the heart of the home where daily activities take place. It covers two key structural elements: the Tiang Seri, which is the main central pillar, and the Atap, the traditional roof structure.

**Balai** - The public space that projects outward to invite the community. It features the Threshold of Humility and explains how it functions as a multi-functional civic space.

**Selang** - The walkway connecting the main house to the kitchen. While appearing as just a corridor, it's actually a critical climatic and social device. The page covers the Venturi Effect for natural ventilation and how it facilitates social interaction.

**Dapur** - The Kitchen, located at the back and lowest part of the house. It explains the Pelantar, an open wooden platform for washing, and how the walls have openings for smoke extraction."

## [1:15-1:50] Technical & Cultural Pages
"**Ikat Mechanism** - This page teaches about the traditional joinery system using Tanggan and Pasak - mortise and tenon joints - that requires no metal nails. It's a key example of traditional Malay construction techniques.

**Traditional Climate Design** - Explains how the house stays cool in hot, humid climates without air conditioning. It covers the Bumbung Bertingkat, the ventilated tiered roof, and the Kolong, the raised floor that allows air circulation underneath.

**Iconography & Ornamentation** - Shows how the carvings are both symbolic and functional. The Kerawang are pierced carvings that provide ventilation, while the motifs feature floral patterns, Islamic geometric designs, and subtle Chinese influences reflecting Kedah's multicultural history."
