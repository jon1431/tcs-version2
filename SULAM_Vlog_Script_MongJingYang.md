## OPENING (30 seconds)

**[Visual: Show yourself in a comfortable setting, maybe with laptop visible]**

Hi everyone, I'm Mong Jing Yang, a Computer Science student at University of Malaya.

*[Pause, smile naturally]*

Over the past week in January, I had the opportunity to work on something really meaningful – a digital exhibition website for Badan Warisan Malaysia. We were helping preserve one of Malaysia's oldest traditional Malay houses, Rumah Penghulu Abu Seman.

*[Lean in slightly, show genuine excitement]*

And honestly? It turned out to be so much more than just another coding project.

## WHAT I DID (45 seconds)

**[Visual: Start showing website screenshots - homepage, then navigate through different sections]**

So, my main role was on the technical side – I focused on designing and organizing the website components. We built this interactive platform using React, and I worked really closely with my teammate Joseph on the implementation.

*[Gesture with hands while talking]*

My specific contributions were... I designed the component architecture – you know, making sure everything was modular and reusable. Like, we created these seven different exhibition categories – Rumah Ibu, the Balai, Selang, the kitchen area...

**[Visual: Show the category page with all exhibition cards]**

Each one needed its own page, but they all had to feel cohesive. So I organized the components, set up the routing structure, and made sure the design system was consistent across all pages.

*[Show enthusiasm]*

Joseph and I also worked together on some really cool interactive features – like this draggable AI chatbox that answers questions about the heritage site, and a quiz challenge that tests visitors' knowledge about traditional Malay architecture.

**[Visual: Briefly show the chatbox being dragged, then the quiz interface]**

## CHALLENGES (45 seconds)

**[Visual: Back to yourself, more serious/thoughtful expression]**

Now, challenges... *[slight laugh]* there were definitely a few.

*[Count on fingers]*

On the technical side, one big hurdle was making the chatbox draggable AND responsive. Sounds simple, right? But getting it to work smoothly on mobile while not breaking the layout... that took some problem-solving. Joseph and I actually had a merge conflict on this feature because we were both working on it simultaneously.

*[Pause, show problem-solving mindset]*

We sat down, went through the code together, and figured out how to integrate both our approaches. It actually made the final implementation stronger.

**[Visual: Optional - show a quick screen recording of the working chatbox]**

But honestly? The non-technical challenge was bigger for me.

*[Slow down, more reflective]*

I had to really understand what we were preserving – this isn't just a house, it's someone's heritage, it's cultural knowledge. I spent time reading about the Tiang Seri pillar, the Ikat joinery system, the Kolong design for ventilation...

*[Look directly at camera]*

I realized I wasn't just organizing components – I was organizing someone's history. That responsibility... that changed how I approached every design decision.

## GROWTH & IMPACT (50 seconds)

**[Visual: Back to comfortable, genuine expression]**

So what did I learn from all this?

*[Pause, think genuinely]*

Technically, I got way better at React architecture and component design. Like, I can structure a complex multi-page application now with confidence. I learned how to implement scroll effects, state management, API integration...

**[Visual: Show some of the polished pages - maybe the Iconography page or Climate page]**

But the personal growth? That hit differently.

*[Softer tone, more introspective]*

I learned that code isn't neutral. Every technical decision I make – how accessible the website is, how the information is organized, whether it works on someone's old phone – these decisions affect whether someone in a kampung or a school student can actually learn about their heritage.

*[Show genuine emotion]*

There was this one moment... when we finished the quiz feature and I was testing it, reading through all the questions about traditional architecture. And I realized – my own grandparents' house had some of these features. The raised floor, the ventilation design. I'd seen them my whole life but never really *understood* them.

**[Visual: Show the quiz in action, or final polished homepage]**

That's when it clicked. This website isn't just for others – it's preserving knowledge that even we, as Malaysians, are at risk of losing.

## CLOSING (40 seconds)

**[Visual: Back to you, confident and sincere]**

So, three key takeaways from this SULAM experience:

*[Use fingers to count]*

**One:** Technical skills are tools, but understanding the community's needs is what makes those tools meaningful.

**Two:** Collaboration isn't just dividing tasks – it's about Joseph and I challenging each other's ideas and building something better together.

**And three:** Heritage preservation isn't just for historians – as tech people, we have a unique power to make cultural knowledge accessible to the next generation.

*[Pause, look directly at camera with conviction]*

Community service, for me as a tech person, means using what I know to amplify voices and preserve stories that might otherwise be forgotten.

**[Visual: Final shot of the complete website, maybe scrolling through homepage]**

It means building bridges between tradition and technology.

*[Smile warmly]*

And that's something I'll carry with me way beyond this project.

*[Let the moment settle, then fade out]*

## DELIVERY NOTES

### Pacing Tips:
- **Opening:** Speak clearly but naturally, like you're telling a friend about your project
- **What I Did:** Pick up energy here - you're excited about the technical work
- **Challenges:** Slow down for the cultural reflection part - this is your "deep" moment
- **Growth & Impact:** Build emotion gradually, especially during the "grandparents' house" story
- **Closing:** Strong, confident finish - you've learned something important

### Visual Cues Summary:
1. **0:00-0:30** - You speaking (opening)
2. **0:30-1:15** - Website screenshots (categories, components, chatbox, quiz)
3. **1:15-2:00** - Back to you (challenges section)
4. **2:00-2:50** - Mix of you + website polish shots (growth section)
5. **2:50-3:30** - You speaking + final website b-roll (closing)

### Emotional Beats:
- Start: **Friendly, approachable**
- Middle: **Thoughtful, vulnerable** (when discussing cultural responsibility)
- Peak: **Genuinely moved** (grandparents' house moment)
- End: **Confident, purposeful**

### Camera Tips:
- Maintain eye contact during emotional moments
- Look at screen when "showing" technical work
- Natural hand gestures - don't overdo it
- Smile genuinely, especially at the beginning and end

---

**PRACTICE TIPS:**
1. Read through 3 times without recording - get comfortable with the flow
2. Don't memorize word-for-word - internalize the KEY POINTS and speak naturally
3. The timestamps are guides - if you're 5-10 seconds off, that's totally fine
4. Record the "grandparents' house" moment last when you're warmed up - it's your emotional anchor
5. If you mess up, just pause and continue - you can edit later!

**YOU'VE GOT THIS!** 🎬
